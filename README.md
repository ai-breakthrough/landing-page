# CoreAI Website

A React-based website served using Docker and Nginx, with automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Local Development

This project can be run locally in multiple ways using Docker.

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Use the development script for easy setup:

```bash
./dev.sh
```

This will present you with options to:
- Start development server with live reload
- Build for production
- Serve production build
- Stop all containers

### Manual Docker Commands

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Running the Website

#### Option 1: Production Build (Static Files)
1. **Build and start the container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Access the website:**
   Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000

3. **Stop the container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

#### Option 2: Development Server (Live Reload)
1. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up dev
   ```

2. **Access the website:**
   Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000
   
3. **Live reload enabled:**
   Changes to your source code will automatically refresh the browser

#### Option 3: Build Only
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up build
```

### Development

- The website serves static files from the `dist/` directory
- Any changes to the `dist/` folder will be reflected immediately due to volume mounting
